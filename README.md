# Milestone 2 
Milestone 2 base code for the corporate batch

## Overview
The Lodging API needs to be able to store, access and update data! The database is being developed to store the data from the end users. Implementation for data access methods are needed for the API to be able to perform queries to the database. 

### Goal
Your goal as a developer is to use LINQ to provide the missing repository implementation such that it:
<ol>
    <li> Complies with the behavior and design decribed in the solution design document </li>
    <li> Passes all the unit tests </li>
</ol>

### Hint
The ```SelectAsync()``` method is fully implemented to show you how to use the components in the ```Repository``` class to query your database. <br> Use this as a guide to implement the other methods!

## Remarks
This Milestone requires you to use asynchrounous LINQ methods to query the database. 

## Checking your work
To test your work, go into the folder containing the solution file. 
<br>
Run command ```dotnet test```. 
<br>
This shows you how many tests you've passed.
